# THE FOLLOWING CODE DOESN'T RUN. THERE'S 2 ERRORS, CAN YOU FIX THEM?

# 17- print every even element of the list, sorted backwards
lst = [1,7,2,6,3,5,4,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,22]
lst_even = []
for element in lst
    if element % 2 = 0:
        lst_even.append(element)
list(reversed(sorted(lst_even)))


Yes: code is corrected below - was missing 'colon' at line 6, and '=' at line 7

lst = [1,7,2,6,3,5,4,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,22]
lst_even = []
for element in lst:
    if element % 2 == 0:
        lst_even.append(element)
list(reversed(sorted(lst_even)))
